  Title: Freeplay Timer and Module Helper
  Description: 'This service helps out for those large bomb cases that have been released
    recently, so that you don''t have to keep clicking your mouse button over and
    over to max out the modules and/or time for the selected bomb case loaded.


    The controls are as follows

    Up arrow - Increase timer.

    Down arrow - Decrease timer.

    Right arrow - Increase module count

    Left arrow - Decrease module count.


    Note - The displayed text is there for illustrative purposes only.  It is not
    actually present in the module itself.

    For as long as the given arrow key is held, the specific thing will increase/decrease
    far faster than you can click the mouse on that same button to do the same result.


    Credits to at_bash for the freeplay reflection code from twitch-plays on which
    I based this on.'
