  Title: Freeplay Timer and Module Helper
  Description: 'This service helps out for those large bomb cases that have been released
    recently, so that you don''t have to keep clicking your mouse button over and
    over to max out the modules and/or time for the selected bomb case loaded.


    The controls are as follows

    Up/Down arrow - Selects the desired freeplay option

    Left/Right arrows - Sets the option.

    Enter - Starts the bomb.  (same as if you clicked the Start button)


    If the freeplay case is currently not open, pressing any of those above keys will
    open the freeplay case, and the Timer option will be selected.


    For as long as Left/Right is held while modules or time is selected, that option
    will increase/decrease continuously, starting slowly, but get faster till it reaches
    top speed, the longer you hold that key.  This is definitely faster than clicking
    your mouse button over and over to get to the desired high setting.


    Credits to at_bash for the freeplay reflection code from twitch-plays on which
    I based this on.'
