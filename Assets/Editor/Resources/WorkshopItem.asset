  Title: Multiple Bombs
  Description: "What's better than a bomb? Two bombs! Take your multitasking skills
    to a new level by defusing two independent bombs at the same time! Two separate
    serials, two separate widget collections, two separate timers, and more!\r\nYou
    can easily change the mod settings from an option in the Free Play menu.\r\nAlso,
    it can work together with custom bomb casings and custom gameplay rooms, so that
    you can have total control over customization!\r\n\r\n[h1]For mod developers[/h1]\r\n[u]Gameplay
    Rooms[/u]\r\nIf you're making a gameplay room and you want to customize the spawns
    of all the bombs, you can do so by simply creating empty gameobjects following
    the naming scheme specified below at the position and rotation where you want
    the bombs to spawn.\r\nThe objects must be named:\r\n[code]MultipleBombs_Spawn_X[/code]\r\nwhere
    [i]X[/i] is the index of the bomb that spawn is for (starting from 0).\r\nImportant
    note: if the bomb count is set to 1, the default bomb spawn is going to be used,
    while the MultipleBombs spawns are going to be used when the bomb count is 2 or
    greater. This allows you (if you want) to specify a different bomb spawn if the
    bomb is just a single one."
